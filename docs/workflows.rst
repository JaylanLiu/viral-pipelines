WDL Workflows
=============

Documentation for each workflow is provided here. Although there are many workflows
that serve different functions, some of the primary workflows we use most often include:
 - demux_plus (on every sequencing run)
 - classify_krakenuniq (included in demux_plus)
 - assemble_denovo (for most viruses)
 - assemble_refbased (for less diverse viruses, such as those from single point source human outbreaks)
 - build_augur_tree (for nextstrain-based visualization of phylogeny)
